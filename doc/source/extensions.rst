There are a few plug-ins and extensions that make for a much better experience.

Gedit
-----

This Gedit plugin adds a menu to allow for running Shoebot scripts. It will open a Shoebot window using the current document as the Shoebot code.

Run the following commands to add the plugin to Gedit::

    cd shoebot/extensions/gedit
    python3 install.py

Now restart Gedit. Navigate to ``Edit > Preferences > Plugins`` and activate the Shoebotit plugin.
